#Time-Utility-Toolkit: A dynamic web application merging a counter, stopwatch, and clock into a unified interface. 

This program leverages concepts such as DOM manipulation, where JavaScript dynamically updates HTML content using methods like getElementById(), and event handling, responding to user actions through event listeners to trigger functions like startStopwatch() when specific events occur.
